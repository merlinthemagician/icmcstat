This directory contains experimental data that was used for the article Siekmann et al. (2014). The time series are part of a data set of type I and type II inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) data collected by Larry Wagner II and David Yule (2012).

The directory structure indicates the experimental conditions - the first level distinguishes type I and type II IP3R, the second level determines the concentrations of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and adenosine trisphosphate (ATP), at the third level various folders for different calcium (Ca) concentrations are found.

The text files (Suffix .dat) all consist of one column that contains single channel currents in pico Ampere (pA). The open conductance level is approximately 40 pA. For further details on the experimental methods, please see Wagner and Yule (2012).
